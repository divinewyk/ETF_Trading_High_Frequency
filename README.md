## Drivers of the ETF Prices

Given the primary and secondary market dynamics for ETFs, the following factors (primarily) influence the ETF prices:



1.	**Underlying securities(fair value of the ETF)**

  - What price is in the NAV for a security and how much is in the basket?
  - How do the securities trade in the open-market (minimum trade sizes, OTC, etc.)
  
  
2.	**Level of ETF supply and demand in the secondary market**
  - More buyer initiated trades (positive flow) may indicate the price will move up. 

  - **Quote book** of the ETF suggests the supply and demand for the ETF

  - ETFs may see NAV Premium/Discounts as prices get bid up or pushed down.

  - APs may conduct primary market transactions to balance order flow
  
  
3.	**Creation/Redemption mechanism costs**
  - Some fund managers charge explicit fees (although these are typically small)
  - Underlying asset prices in the NAV vs. prices at which the APs transact may be different
  
  
4.	**Level of underlying asset market volatility and liquidity**
  - Exactly how confident is the AP that it can transact in the underlying securities on the open market at prices equal to or better than NAV prices?
  

The previous figure of SPY vs. HYG NAV Premium/Discounts generalizes for ETFs on assets with high standardization and liquidity vs. other assets. Larger, more persistent, and more volatile NAV Premiums/Discounts tend to exist where the underlying assets are characterized by less liquidity and more price uncertainty. 

In this framework, we find US-listed **corporate bond ETFs** to be a particularly interesting area of study and especially in the year **2020** with the pandemic involving a lot of illiquidity.
